# Gastronomy-website
A simple website I created for anyone interested in food around the world
(implemented in HTML+CSS with a bit of JavaScript)

The website has a main page ("Acasa") with a short introduction about what gastronomy means.
The "In jurul lumii" section contains 3 tabs on the side and a map with a few colored countries, each of which will take you on another page presenting a different country's food.
In the "Retete" section each circle should open with a video on the topic.
The "Deserturi" part contains a slide show implemented in JavaScript that displays desserts from all over the world.

*In order for the site to work properly, the images from 'Images' folder should be in the same folder as the html pages*
*Also, the videos were not uploaded because of their size*
