# Gastronomy-website
A simple website I created for anyone interested in food around the world  
(implemented in HTML+CSS with a bit of JavaScript, language: Romanian)

- The website has a main page ("Acasa") with a short introduction about what gastronomy means. (main.jpg)
- The "In jurul lumii" section contains 3 tabs on the side and a map with a few colored countries (map.jpg), each of which will take you on another page presenting a different country's food. (country.jpg)
- In the "Retete" section each circle should open with a video on the topic. (videos.jpg)
- The "Deserturi" part contains a slide show implemented in JavaScript that displays desserts from all over the world. (slideshow.jpg)

*In order for the site to work properly, the images from 'Images' folder should be in the same folder as the html pages*  
*Also, the videos were not uploaded because of their size*
